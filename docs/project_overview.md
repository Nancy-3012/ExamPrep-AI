## ExamPrep AI – Project Overview

ExamPrep AI is an AI-based academic assistant designed to help students prepare for examinations. The system generates exam-oriented questions using syllabus and notes provided by the user.

The project ensures that all generated questions are strictly based on the uploaded content by using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which reduces irrelevant or hallucinated responses.

This project focuses on educational applications of Large Language Models.
